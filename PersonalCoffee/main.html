                        Did you know that the term "green coffee" is used for unroasted coffee beans? Nevertheless, our store is more than that; one of the main motives regarding this establishment is passion. Coffee has always been a staple partner within our life success. Whilst we delight the finest cups of freshly brewed coffe, we also get to spend more time with each other. At intimate gatherings or even boardroom meetings, a coffee drink is indispensable. As coffee enthusiasts we have the certainty that the freshly roasted coffee beans are the best.</p><br>
                              <p>On the 15th of August of 2015, we opened our first shop, The Green Coffee, located on Blank street, in the heart of the city. Our concept of a coffe shop is detached from the "basic-looking café", we have the intention to be a modern minimalist design with an Earth-friendly approach. we believe that the best way to savor coffee is not to alienate nature but to befriend it.

                    Roasting brings out the aroma and flavour that is locked inside the green coffee beans which are properly stored. This means they are in a state in which they can be kept without loss of quality or taste. A green bean has none of the characteristics of a roasted bean; it is soft and spongy to the bite with a grassy smell. 
                </p><br><p> Roasting causes chemical changes to take place as the beans are rapidly brought to very high temperatures. When they reach the peak of perfection, they are quickly cooled to stop the process. Roasted beans smell like coffee, and weigh less because the moisture has been roasted out. They are crunchy to the bite, ready to be ground and brewed.

              <br><h6>Light roast.</h6>
              <p>Light brown in color, this roast is generally preferred for milder coffee varieties. There will be no oil on the surface of these beans because they are not roasted long enough for the oils to break through to the surface.</p>
              <br><h6>Medium roast.</h6>
              <p>This roast is medium brown in color with a stronger flavor and a non-oily surface. It’s often referred to as the American roast</p>
              <br><h6>Medium dark roasts</h6>
              <p>Rich, dark color, this roast has some oil on the surface and with a slight bittersweet aftertaste.</p>
              <br><h6>Dark roasts</h6>
              <p>This roast produces shiny black beans with an oily surface and a pronounced bitterness. The darker the roast, the less acidity will be found in the coffee beverage.</p>
